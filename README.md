# üöÄ Features

All features are off by default so you can ease your way into things but I highly recommend either the Starter Profile for a quick start with all the core minimalistic features enabled or one of the more advanced profiles!

## üîÑ Classic & Retail Nameplate Options

Switch between classic and retail nameplate styles depending on your preference. You can have retail nameplates on classic and classic nameplates on retail!
