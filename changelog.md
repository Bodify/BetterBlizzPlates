## All versions
### Bugfix

- Nameplate Auras: "Purgeable" filter now has a Shift-Rightclick setting to only display purgeable auras if your class has a purge. This is checking Blizzards default logic whether or not you have a purge.
### Tweak
- Little tweak to how the default nameplate font is handled. This was poorly handled from way back when and this should fix some issues. However there have been weird issues spawning from attempting to change this behaviour before. If you are seeing any issues with the nameplate font with this new change please type "/bbp oldfonts"
- Health Numbers now copies outline and shadow from nameplate name on creation (untested).

- Things to look out for on this new patch:

## All versions

### Tweak:
- "Small Pets" setting now also reduces the width of your own Pet while in World, but actually this time.
## Classic versions
### Tweak:
- Small Pets and Totem Indicator Width settings have been updated to be similar to their more up-to-date Retail version. Due to this the width of affected nameplates may have changed a little bit and you might have to re-adjust them slightly.
### Bugfix:
- MoP Beta: Fix player role check for Threat Color causing lua errors due to API changes on MoP Beta.
- Fix a logic issue causing nameplates to always be class colored regardless of settings.

# BetterBlizzPlates 1.8.1
## Mists of Pandaria Beta
### No beta access :/
- I don't have beta access so cant work on support. I made it so MoP loads Cata files for now but it's unlikely this will work without changes, and NPC lists need updates etc. If you bugreport I might be able to fix it up, contact me.
## All versions

# BetterBlizzPlates 1.8.0e
## Retail

# BetterBlizzPlates 1.8.0c
## Retail
### New:
- Party Pointer: New setting to enable/disable showing CC on top of Party Pointer (Advanced Settings). This is on by default.
- Hide Healthbar (Friendly): New subsetting that lets you keep healthbars on tanks and healers in PvE. Shift+Rightclick the checkbox to toggle.
### Tweak:
- Class Icon and Party Pointer CC overlay will now not be shown if Key Auras on Friendly Nameplates are enabled.
- Updated the PvE healthbar hiding function a little bit.
### Bugfix:
- Fix bug from patch 1.8.0 causing some nameplate auras to become hidden/glitchy with Party Pointer enabled due to a flaw in some of the new logic.


# BetterBlizzPlates 1.8.0b
## Retail
### Bugfix:
- Fix a lua error in nameplate auras.



# BetterBlizzPlates 1.8.0
## Retail:
### New:
- Nameplate Auras: New subsetting for "Blizzard Default Filter". Lets you keep the Default Blizzard Filter but hide others auras. Similar to the "Only Mine" filter but doesn't add trash auras that are yours that you need to blacklist.
- Party Pointer: 13 more textures to pick from in the Advanced Settings Section. The last option lets you enter a custom atlas texture too.
- Hide Friendly Healthbar setting now has a "Show Pet" subsetting by shift+rightclicking to allow pet to still be shown.
### Tweak:
- Made CC show on top of Party Pointer as well.
- Hide Friendly Healthbar NPCs setting now also works in PvE Dungeons and there is a new right-click setting on the same checkbox that you can enable if you want npc healthbars to be kept shown in PvE only.
- Castbar Customizations' "Change background texture" setting made it so the background was red on un-interruptible casts, despite the color setting. This was only intended temporarily until settings got made but was forgotten about. This is now off by default but can still be enabled again by right-clicking the color button in /bbp -> Castbar -> Color button next to "Change background texture".
### Bugfix:
- Fix Class Indicators Pet setting being dependant on pin mode by accident.
- Fix "Purgeable" aura filter causing non-purgeable buffs from the "PvP Buffs" filter to not show, this was unintended.
- Fix issue with Fade NPCs + Hide Friendly NPC Healthbar causing frame to get completely hidden instead of its set value.
## Retail, Cata, Classic
### New:
- Threat Color: DPS/Heal: "Targeted" color. This color kicks in when you are targeted but dont have aggro. Default same color as Full Aggro but now you have the option to change it.
### Tweak:
- Cata/Era: Due to Nameplate Class Color CVar being crazy wonky (Blizzard handles this, not BBP) I have added a tweak that should force Blizzard to Class Color them if the setting is enabled. However this will not be able to fix it for friendly nameplates in PvE instances due to restrictions. If you are having issues with this you may have to clear your WTF folder or even do a fresh install. I could not figure out the cause of this rare bug other than it being from Blizzard.
### Bugfix:
- Totem Indicator was not able to detect NPC ID on players own Pet and possibly some other cases too, that is now fixed.

- Nameplate Shadow: Target Only setting.
### Tweaks:
- Key Auras now have more auras in the list. I've been a bit more lenient on what to show and allowed more to be shown here. What is a key aura? Currently a key aura is: CC, Immunity, and a few other big, but short duration auras requiring a shift in gameplay.
- Added duration to show on Sanctified Ground and Absolute Serenity auras with aura settings enabled.
- Nameplate Aura settings are now enabled by default for new users.
### Bugfix:
- Fix Nameplate Shadow: "Highlight shadow on Mouseover" always being active regardless of that setting being on or not.
- Fixed Rebuke showing on Paladin's nameplates when using it with interrupts enabled. Rebuke is also an aura Paladins get when they use it for some reason... This was not accounted for.

# BetterBlizzPlates 1.6.8d
## Classic Era/SoD
- Early Alpha version of BBP for Classic Era/SoD. Please report bugs, very limited testing has been done. Classic Era and Cataclysm will support eachothers import codes 100%. This version will just have the cata totem list, so not very accurate.

## The War Within
### New stuff:

## The War Within
### New Stuff:
- Misc: Nameplate Shadow & Mouseover Highlight settings. The mouseover detection is not perfect, especially with overlapping nameplates, but until I can figure out a better method it will stay like this.
### Tweak:

- Fixed up Party Pointer test mode.
### Bugfix:

- Fix Execute Indicator mistake from an earlier patch causing a lua error with certain anchors.
## Cataclysm
### Tweak:

- Health Numbers: Class Color setting.

- Execute Indicator: Use Texture setting that displays a line instead of text.
### Tweak:
- Aura Color: "Only in PvE" setting now also does not color Player nameplates and has a better tooltip description.
- Nameplate Auras are now anchored to the healthbar (was NamePlate.UnitFrame) with Nameplate Auras settings enabled. This makes it so when increasing castbar height with Castbar Emphasis the auras follow properly.
- Tweak Pandemic Timers to never go below base duration (Rot and Decay refresh caused wrong timings)
### Bugfix:
- Fix Hide elite icon setting overlapping other setting in the GUI
- Fix elite icon popping back up even with the hide setting on.

- Fix GUI slider for Castbar Emphasis Spark Height accidentally adjusting Emphasis Text Size instead.
## Cataclysm
### Bugfix:

### Tweak:
- Castbar Emphasis now makes the castbar appear on top of everything else so you dont miss a cast thats been emphasized.
### Bugfix:
- Fix Personal Resource Bar sometimes not picking up special auras like Frenzy that are not shown elsewhere with Nameplate Aura settings on.
- Fix Druid Blue Combos sometimes not being in order

# BetterBlizzPlates 1.6.4
## The War Within
### New stuff:
- Mmarkers profile
- Party Pointer "Healer only" setting
### Tweak:
- Pandemic Glow for auras that have a pandemic effect is now properly glowing when 30% of their duration is left instead of a flat 5 sec like it was before. For non-pandemic auras the default timer is still 5sec. For UA and Agony if their refresh talents are picked the Pandemic Glow will first be orange when it enters that range and then turn red when it also enters the 30% window.
### Bugfix:
- Fix the Interrupt CD Color spark positioning on channeled casts.
- Fix "Castbar Edge Highlight" causing lua errors in PvE.

- Changed the color of Priests Re-Fear Shadow NPC to a more pinkish less threathening color (Was too similar to Psyfiend).

- Fixed Druid Blue ComboPoints not getting activated if Druid was not in catform during login/reload.
- Fixed "Hide nameplate auras" on general page not working immediately
### Known issue:
- Nameplate resource can attach to wrong nameplates (with attach under nameplate setting?)

# BetterBlizzPlates 1.6.3b
## The War Within
### Tweak:
- Reposition Name now has a "Raise Strata" setting that is on by default.
- Make it so "Small Pets in PvP" only reduces the width of npcs that are not in the Totem Indicator if that feature is enabled. This was the intended behaviour but was only active if "Totem Width" setting was on.
### Bugfix:
- Fix Reposition Name no longer overlapping healthbar like intended by introducing new setting.
- Fix refresh of nameplates putting cast timer text back to default value instead of `BetterBlizzPlatesDB.npTargetTextSize`, this will get gui settings in a future patch.

- Fix issue with castbar customization enabled causing castbars to be white if ClassicFrames was enabled.

# BetterBlizzPlates 1.6.3
## The War Within
### New stuff:

- Arena Nameplates (spec name / id) now also has a setting to show spec names in Battlegrounds.
- New misc setting: Skip GUI, minmax setting that doesnt load GUI into the game until needed.
### Tweak:
- Added Monk Images (Storm, Earth & Fire) to Hide NPC & Fade NPC whitelists.
- Removed "Fade all but target" setting from Fade NPC. It doesnt make sense anymore after adding whitelist mode.
- Made Totem Indicator hide BigDebuffs icon on Totems on Retail as well when healthbar is hidden.
- Changed default color on Evoker "Past Self" NPC in Totem Indicator, original color was too close to evoker themself causing some confusion. This change will only be active for new users.
### Bugfix:
- Fix issue with Hide NPC causing Target nameplate to sometimes appear behind other nameplates.
- Fix issue with reposition name sometimes not repositioning.
- Fix issues with Fade NPC in combination with Fade Non-Target Nameplates

- Fix issue with Smoke Bomb debuff on nameplates multiplying its cooldown frame across other auras.
- Fix Healer Indicator Anchor selections in Advanced Settings being backwards for enemy & friendly.

# BetterBlizzPlates 1.6.2
## The War Within
### Important Change:
- Changed default values for cvars: nameplateMinScale and nameplateMaxScale. They are originally 0.8 and 1, I've put them both to 0.85.
You can change of course this value but they will now be linked and have the same value.
This makes nameplates always keep the same size instead of scaling up and down tiny amounts depending on range.
The reason I've done this is because it opens up a lot of possibilities to do things I couldnt normally do due to cpu usage concerns, and probably even makes wow run a little lighter alltogether.
You might notice your non-target nameplates have changed (very minimal) in size and to re-adjust just go to /bbp -> Nameplate Size
### New stuff:
- Totem Indicator can now change the width of nameplate healthbars, made possible by the important change above.
- Name Reposition has been changed to no longer create a fake name but instead move the original one, should make it less prone to bugs, made possible by the important change above.
- Added cooldown timer on Smoke Bomb debuff. This also supports nameplate icons for BigDebuffs and OmniAuras.
- Subsettings for "Hide castbar" on Enemy & Friendly nameplates: "Show on Target". Right-Click the "Hide castbar" setting to toggle on/off.
- Subsettings for "Hide healthbar" on Enemy & Friendly nameplates: "Show on Target". Right-Click the "Hide healthbar" setting to toggle on/off.
- Show Druid Berserk Overcharge as blue on nameplate combo points.
### Tweak:
- Nahj profile update
- Pandemic timer for Agony and Unstable Affliction is now 10s and 8s instead of the regular 5s if the talents are learned.
- "Hide auras on totems" from Totem Indicator is now off by default instead. Could be confusing for dot classes.
- I've added a variable that controls size for nameplate target text and cast timer. Atm no GUI yet, default value is 11, you can change this size by writing /run BetterBlizzPlatesDB.npTargetTextSize = 11
- I've also added a variable that controls font outline for health numbers, also without GUI, to change it do /run BetterBlizzPlatesDB.healthNumbersFontOutline = "OUTLINE"    (or "THICKOUTLINE", or nil)
- Absorb Indicator now says millions instead of thousands. 7300k -> 7.3m
- Added Voidwraith (priest npc), Shadowfiend and Surge Totem to Totem Indicator and Hide/Fade Whitelists.
- General performance tweaks.
### Bugfix:
- Fix an issue with the "Hide castbar" setting for friendly nameplates potentially getting stuck.

- Reworked how Name Reposition works and fixed issues with it in combination with Arena Names + Party Pointer.
- Fix threat color coloring friendly units (since no check was needed before the always on setting)
- Fix "Castbar Edge Highlight" erroring in PvE content.

## The War Within
### New:
- Made the the TWW Target Highlight fix optional, setting in Misc.
### Bugfix:
- Fixed friendly auras being positioned too high with clickthrough friendly nameplate setting on. This was due to splitting the clickthrough setting into two different ones and this logic should rely on the new separated setting instead and not clickthrough.

# BetterBlizzPlates 1.5.9c
## The War Within
### New stuff:
- Non-Target Nameplate Alpha setting in CVar Control. (This is a CVar on cata but not on retail)
### Tweak:
- Split friendly nameplate "Clickthrough" setting into two settings: One for clickthrough itself and other one for nonstackable. This change is because the nonstackable setting can cause issues and better left optional.
### Bugfix:
- Fix a lua error from nameplate auras occouring in some rare cases.
- Fix an issue for people who had deleted Skyfury Totem from their totem list causing the attempted update to its totem name to fail and make settings fail to load.
