# BetterBlizzPlates 1.9.0
## The Burning Crusade
- Very early and scuffed TBC support. Not very well tested and no default spells/npcs updated for TBC. Best I can do for now. Please report bugs. Any support in terms of spell ids and npc ids etc is welcome.
## Midnight
### Tweak
- Some tweaks to nameplate height and width so they can be adjusted separately between friendly enemy again after Blizzard removed the default API for it. This will see more tweaks in the future so don't expect your settings to be 100% until a full release sometime before Midnight release.
## All versions
### Bugfix
- Fix all gui subcategories not showing instantly when loading GUI.
