# BetterBlizzPlates 1.9.1
## The Burning Crusade
### Tweak
- Tweak nameplate height and name position in TBC. Tweak needed for Era/Cata is no longer needed for TBC and caused nameplates to be much shorter than intended. You will have to re-adjust your nameplate height (General) and nameplate name position settings (Advanced Settings).
- Fixup aura spell ids for Key Auras, PvP Buffs & CC Filters.
